## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a diverse range of projects covering artificial intelligence, game development, computer vision, data engineering, and more. Each project focuses on different aspects of these domains, providing opportunities to explore various techniques and methodologies.

## Projects

### [Movie Assistant](movie-assistant)

The Movie Assistant project aims to build a conversational AI system that assists users in discovering movies, providing recommendations, and offering information about movies and actors. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and movie-related datasets.

### Hangman

The Hangman project is an interactive game where players attempt to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. It showcases the implementation of a classic word-guessing game using Python and demonstrates basic programming concepts.

### Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors

The Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors project combines computer vision techniques with machine learning to create a system capable of recognizing hand gestures for the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The project involves image processing, deep learning, and real-time object recognition.

### Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

The Multinational Retail Data Centralisation project focuses on consolidating and centralizing retail data from multiple branches of a multinational company. It involves designing a data architecture, implementing data pipelines, and applying data integration and transformation techniques.

### Data Engineering Specialisation

The Data Engineering Specialisation project encompasses a comprehensive set of projects and exercises to master the field of data engineering. It covers various topics such as data modeling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data warehousing, data lakes, and more. Each project within this specialisation addresses specific data engineering challenges.

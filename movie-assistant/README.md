## Project Description

The Movie Assistant project is designed to help users explore and interact with a movie dataset. It provides various functionalities to retrieve essential information about movies based on user input, such as genre selection and movie details.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Understand the Data
- Tasks:
  1. Immerse yourself in the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its contents.
- Prerequisite Lessons:
  - Lesson 1: Introduction to Movie Datasets
  - Lesson 2: Data Exploration Techniques
  - Lesson 3: Understanding Movie Metadata

### Milestone 2: Explore the Data
- Tasks:
  1. Develop a set of functions to calculate and display essential information about the `movies` dataset.
- Prerequisite Lessons:
  - Lesson 1: Python Basics
  - Lesson 2: Working with Data in Python
  - Lesson 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas
  - Lesson 4: Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas
  - Lesson 5: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

### Milestone 3: Create Some Functions for the Movie Assistant
- Tasks:
  1. Build the individual components of the system that will later be composed to produce the entire solution.
- Prerequisite Lessons:
  - Lesson 1: Introduction to Functions in Python
  - Lesson 2: Functions with Parameters and Return Values

### Milestone 4: Build the Movie Assistant
- Tasks:
  1. Put together the functions defined so far to build the complete movie assistant project.
  2. Ask the user to select a genre and a movie from a list.
  3. Display the details of the selected movie.
- Prerequisite Lessons:
  - None

### Milestone 5: Introduce Error Handling for your Code

## Introduction

The Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors project aims to build a system that can accurately recognize and classify the hand gestures representing "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors." This involves training a machine learning model on a dataset of hand gesture images and implementing real-time object recognition using computer vision techniques.

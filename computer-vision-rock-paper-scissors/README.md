## Introduction

The Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors project aims to build a system that can accurately recognize and classify the hand gestures representing "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors." This involves training a machine learning model on a dataset of hand gesture images and implementing real-time object recognition using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Real-time recognition of hand gestures using computer vision.
- Classification of hand gestures into "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
- Simple graphical interface for user interaction.

## Getting Started

To run the Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/freestyleabg/aicore.git`
2. Navigate to the Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors directory: `cd aicore/computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python camera_rps.py`

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed on your machine.

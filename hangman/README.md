## Description

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game "Hangman" in Python.

The aim of this project is to provide an entertaining way to practice programming skills while playing a familiar game. By working on this Hangman implementation, you can improve your Python coding, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.

## Installation

To run the Hangman game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/freestyleabg/aicore.git`
2. Navigate to the Hangman directory: `cd aicore/hangman`
3. Run the game: `python hangman.py`

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Run the game by executing the `hangman.py` script.
2. The game will choose a random word for you to guess.
3. Guess letters one at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
6. Keep guessing until you either guess the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn.

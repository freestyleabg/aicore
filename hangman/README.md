## Introduction

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player has to guess a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's body is drawn. The player wins if they can guess the word before the entire hangman is drawn.

This project is a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. It's a great way to practice your programming skills and have fun at the same time.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `hangman.py` script.
2. The game will choose a random word for you to guess.
3. Guess letters one at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
6. Keep guessing until you either guess the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Visual representation of the hangman's progress.
- Limited number of attempts before the hangman is fully drawn.
